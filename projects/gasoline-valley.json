  "description": "It Took Three Weeks to Scroll Through the Gasoline Valley was a collaborative virtual group project aimed at challenging the traditional hierarchies and exclusivity often found in exhibition spaces through the medium of virtual world-building.\n\nIn collaboration with six other talented artists, Gil took on the responsibility for the Blender elements and overall curation. By digitally transforming the artworks of the group into a cohesive and interconnected collection, the project emphasized a deliberate absence of favoritism.\n\nThrough the unification of these pieces in the virtual realm, the collective sought to communicate their shared goal of deconstructing hierarchical exhibition structures.\n\nArtists: Gil Altarace Sherman, Dora Perini, Vincenzo Ottino, Zachary Berry, Maria Gambara, Lottie Stephens",
