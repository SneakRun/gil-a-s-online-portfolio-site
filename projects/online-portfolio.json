  "description": "This online portfolio is a custom-built web application designed to showcase my work and practice as a creative technologist. Inspired originally from a previous p5.js sketch, this online portfolio was rebuilt in 2024 with the intention of being a more flexible and extensible portfolio platform than what is offered by Cargo, where my original portfolio was hosted. It features a responsive layout, dynamic content loading, and interactive elements that highlight my projects and skills.\n\n<a href=\"https://editor.p5js.org/SneakRun/sketches/AWit7nt3T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View the original p5.js sketch that inspired this portfolio.</a>",
