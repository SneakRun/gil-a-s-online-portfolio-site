  "description": "Commissioned by Cubitts for their Hampstead Collection, the sunglasses were inspired by the local architecture of the Isokon firm and its constructivist roots.\n\nThe project combined Design Thinking principles with a human-centered approach, with a focus on empathy and understanding of user needs at every stage, from prototyping through to production.\n\nCollaboration across different teams played a crucial role in refining the design's adaptability and problem-solving, ensuring the product not only met market expectations but also overcame unforeseen challenges.",
