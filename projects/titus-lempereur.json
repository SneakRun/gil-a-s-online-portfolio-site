  "title": "Titus L'Empereur: Backdrop Design",
  "description": "Made for the 2024 production of Titus L'Empereur at the Carl Maria von Weber Theatre in Munich, this project involved designing an animated backdrop projection that would respond to the action on stage. Produced in Blender, the respective elements of the tryptich were made to match the climaxes of the opera's canon, creating an audiovisual experience that complements the classical narrative while challenging the conventions of theatrical presentation.\nI was responsible for the left building element of the project, while other elements were designed and composited by Spike Silverton.",
