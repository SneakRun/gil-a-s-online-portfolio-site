  "description": "Remesh is a font created through collaboration with procedural software, inspired by Johanna Hedva’s ‘Sick Woman Theory’ and the physical demands associated with activism.\n\nI wanted to examine to examine how language accessibility could be reimagined through Hedva’s writing, and the implications of a partnership between software and humans. As someone with ADHD, I empathise with individuals who find it difficult to read large amounts of text.\n\nMade in Blender using procedural generation plugins, Remeshaims to challenge the utility of language when it ceases to be accessible—exploring the outcome when a functional typeface becomes virtually unreadable for its audience.",
