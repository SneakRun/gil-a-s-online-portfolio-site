  "description": "The John Hardy 'Moment Maker' UI is an interactive web-based procedural flower interface designed for enhancing and personalising the user-end shopping experience as they explore jewelry pieces as gifts for one's mother.\n\nDeveloped in 2024 as part of a contract with R/GA, this interactive web tool allows users to curate the jewelry options presented to them by attributing John Hardy's five most impactful characteristics of the 'Heroic Mother'. \n\nEach combination of these attributes creates unique 'Hero' flower that corresponds to the selected John Hardy jewelry pieces, providing a personalized and engaging way to explore the brand's collection.\n\n<a href='https://johnhardy.com/en-uk/pages/moment-maker' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Visit the Moment Maker Page</a>",
