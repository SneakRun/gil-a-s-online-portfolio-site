By reassembling digital found objects, 'Dream Eater' aims to demonstrate how this approach can bring more playfulness to 3D modelling, making it more accessible to both beginners and experienced users.\n\nDrawing on nostalgic imagery, the game uses childhood experiences as a framework for exploring intersections between Ontology, Semiology, and Pervasive Game Theory.",
